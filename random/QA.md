### Question 1
**Q: Explain Gauss' theorem / Green's theorem / divergence theorem**

**A:** These are all names for the same fundamental theorem in vector calculus, which is crucial for electrodynamics. The theorem relates a volume integral of the divergence of a vector field to a surface integral over the boundary of that volume.

**Mathematical Statement:**
$$\iiint_V (\nabla \cdot \mathbf{F}) \, dV = \iint_S \mathbf{F} \cdot \hat{\mathbf{n}} \, dS$$

Where:
- $V$ is a volume in 3D space
- $S$ is the closed surface bounding volume $V$
- $\mathbf{F}$ is a vector field
- $\nabla \cdot \mathbf{F}$ is the divergence of $\mathbf{F}$
- $\hat{\mathbf{n}}$ is the outward unit normal vector to surface $S$

**Geometrical Interpretation:**
Imagine the vector field $\mathbf{F}$ as representing the flow of some fluid. The divergence $\nabla \cdot \mathbf{F}$ at any point tells us the rate at which fluid is being created (positive divergence) or destroyed (negative divergence) per unit volume at that point.

The left side $\iiint_V (\nabla \cdot \mathbf{F}) \, dV$ adds up all the sources and sinks throughout the volume $V$.

The right side $\iint_S \mathbf{F} \cdot \hat{\mathbf{n}} \, dS$ measures the net flux flowing outward through the boundary surface $S$.

**The key insight:** If fluid is being created inside the volume, it must flow out through the surface. If fluid is being destroyed inside, there must be a net inward flow through the surface. The divergence theorem quantifies this balance precisely - the total creation/destruction inside equals the net outward flow.

**Key Applications in Electrodynamics:**

1. **Gauss's Law for Electric Fields:**
   $$\oint \mathbf{E} \cdot d\mathbf{S} = \frac{Q_{\text{enc}}}{\varepsilon_0}$$
   The electric flux through any closed surface is proportional to the enclosed charge.

2. **Gauss's Law for Magnetic Fields:**
   $$\oint \mathbf{B} \cdot d\mathbf{S} = 0$$
   Magnetic flux through any closed surface is zero (no magnetic monopoles).

3. **Continuity Equation:**
   $$\nabla \cdot \mathbf{J} + \frac{\partial \rho}{\partial t} = 0$$
   Conservation of charge using divergence theorem.

**Intuitive Understanding:**
Think of water flowing through a region. If water is being created inside a volume (positive divergence), then more water must flow out through the surface than flows in. The divergence theorem quantifies this relationship precisely.

**Verification Example:**
Let's verify the theorem for a simple case to build intuition.

**Given:** Vector field $\mathbf{F} = x\hat{\mathbf{x}} + y\hat{\mathbf{y}} + z\hat{\mathbf{z}}$ and a cube with vertices at $(0,0,0)$ and $(a,a,a)$.

**Step 1 - Calculate the divergence:**
$$\nabla \cdot \mathbf{F} = \frac{\partial}{\partial x}(x) + \frac{\partial}{\partial y}(y) + \frac{\partial}{\partial z}(z) = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3$$

**Step 2 - Volume integral (LHS):**
$$\iiint_V (\nabla \cdot \mathbf{F}) \, dV = \iiint_V 3 \, dV = 3 \cdot a^3 = 3a^3$$

**Step 3 - Surface integral (RHS):**
The cube has 6 faces. Let's calculate the flux through each:

- **Right face** ($x = a$): $\mathbf{F} = a\hat{\mathbf{x}} + y\hat{\mathbf{y}} + z\hat{\mathbf{z}}$, $\hat{\mathbf{n}} = \hat{\mathbf{x}}$
  $$\iint (a\hat{\mathbf{x}} + y\hat{\mathbf{y}} + z\hat{\mathbf{z}}) \cdot \hat{\mathbf{x}} \, dS = \iint a \, dy \, dz = a^3$$

- **Left face** ($x = 0$): $\mathbf{F} = y\hat{\mathbf{y}} + z\hat{\mathbf{z}}$, $\hat{\mathbf{n}} = -\hat{\mathbf{x}}$
  $$\iint (y\hat{\mathbf{y}} + z\hat{\mathbf{z}}) \cdot (-\hat{\mathbf{x}}) \, dS = 0$$

Similarly for the other faces:
- **Top face** ($y = a$): flux = $a^3$
- **Bottom face** ($y = 0$): flux = $0$  
- **Front face** ($z = a$): flux = $a^3$
- **Back face** ($z = 0$): flux = $0$

**Total surface flux:** $a^3 + 0 + a^3 + 0 + a^3 + 0 = 3a^3$

**Verification:** LHS = RHS = $3a^3$ âœ“

**Physical Insight:** The field $\mathbf{F} = x\hat{\mathbf{x}} + y\hat{\mathbf{y}} + z\hat{\mathbf{z}}$ points radially outward from the origin with magnitude proportional to distance. Since $\nabla \cdot \mathbf{F} = 3 > 0$ everywhere, we have a uniform "source" throughout the volume, creating net outward flux through all surfaces.

**Important Notes:**
- The surface must be closed (no boundaries)
- The vector field must be differentiable in the region
- This theorem is fundamental to deriving Maxwell's equations in integral and differential forms
